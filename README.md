**Introduction**
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a widely adopted modulation technique in modern wireless communication systems, including LTE, Wi-Fi, and 5G. While OFDM offers significant advantages such as high spectral efficiency and resilience to multipath fading, it suffers from a major drawbackâ€” a high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). High PAPR leads to inefficiencies in power amplifiers, causing signal distortion and reducing overall system performance.

This project focuses on addressing the PAPR problem in OFDM systems. It explores traditional and advanced techniques for PAPR reduction, comprehensively analysing their effectiveness and trade-offs. Through MATLAB/Simulink simulations, the project evaluates how these techniques can improve the efficiency and reliability of OFDM-based communication systems, ultimately contributing to more robust and energy-efficient wireless networks.
