# PAPR-Reduction-in-OFDM-Modulation Using Selective Mapping, Clippling and Filtering Techniques

This project explores and implements various techniques for reducing the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. High PAPR is a critical issue in OFDM, leading to inefficiencies in power amplifiers and increased transmission costs. By investigating both traditional and advanced PAPR reduction methods, this project aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of OFDM-based communication systems.

Key Features:
Implementation of Classic PAPR Reduction Techniques: Includes Clipping and Filtering, Selective Mapping (SLM), and Partial Transmit Sequences (PTS).
Advanced Reduction Approaches: Explores newer methodologies like Tone Reservation (TR) and Active Constellation Extension (ACE).
Performance Analysis: Comprehensive evaluation of the trade-offs between PAPR reduction, computational complexity, and signal distortion.
Simulation Environment: MATLAB/Simulink-based simulations for validating the effectiveness of the implemented techniques.
