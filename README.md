# PAPR-Reduction-in-OFDM-Modulation Using Selective Mapping, Clippling and Filtering Techniques

This project explores and implements various techniques for reducing the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. High PAPR is a critical issue in OFDM, leading to inefficiencies in power amplifiers and increased transmission costs. By investigating both traditional and advanced PAPR reduction methods, this project aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of OFDM-based communication systems.

**Key Features**:
Implementation of Classic PAPR Reduction Techniques: Includes Clipping and Filtering, Selective Mapping (SLM).
Advanced Reduction Approaches: Explores newer methodologies like Tone Reservation (TR) and Active Constellation Extension (ACE).
Performance Analysis: The trade-offs between PAPR reduction, computational complexity, and signal distortion are comprehensively evaluated.
Simulation Environment: MATLAB/Simulink-based simulations are used to validate the effectiveness of the implemented techniques.

**Introduction**
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a widely adopted modulation technique in modern wireless communication systems, including LTE, Wi-Fi, and 5G. While OFDM offers significant advantages such as high spectral efficiency and resilience to multipath fading, it suffers from a major drawbackâ€” a high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). High PAPR leads to inefficiencies in power amplifiers, causing signal distortion and reducing overall system performance.

This project focuses on addressing the PAPR problem in OFDM systems. It explores both traditional and advanced techniques for PAPR reduction, providing a comprehensive analysis of their effectiveness and trade-offs. Through MATLAB/Simulink simulations, the project evaluates how these techniques can improve the efficiency and reliability of OFDM-based communication systems, ultimately contributing to more robust and energy-efficient wireless networks.
